                    Cross-domain sentiment analysis (CDSA) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task
that involves analyzing and predicting sentiment across different domains or areas, such as
product reviews, social media, and movie feedback. In CDSA, models trained on one
domain (e.g., electronics) must adapt to a different domain (e.g., books) where language,
vocabulary, and contextual cues can vary widely. Traditional sentiment analysis models
perform well within specific domains but often struggle with new, unseen domains,
limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications like social media monitoring,
customer feedback analysis, and market research. We propose a novel approach combining
Elmo’s deep contextualized embeddings with BERT's robust sentiment classification.
ELMo captures word-level dependencies and nuances, while BERT, with its transformer
architecture, excels in understanding complex language structures. This is the first
approach to use ELMo for cross-domain sentiment analysis in Bangla, addressing a critical
gap in this language. Experimental results show that our ELMo-BERT model outperforms
traditional models, achieving higher accuracy and robustness, making it highly adaptable
for real-world applications across diverse Bangla datasets.

                    In this study we analyzed different well-established machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL) supervised models to enable the risk prediction of
maternal health, thus offering a viable and systematic technique to automatically
identify pregnancy risk. The Maternal Health Risk Data Set, which covers various
critical attributes such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature,
heart rate, and risk level, was applied [8]. Data pretreatment methods, including
deleting missing data (if any) and conducting feature scaling and selection, were
incorporated to create the model. Different ML models were created and tested,
including but not limited to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
(RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), as well as deep learning architectures such as
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Model performances were evaluated using
metric measures, including accuracy and F1 scores. Of them, CNN showed the
highest accuracy (98.58), exceeding alternative models by its capacity to uncover
spatial correlations crucial for successful risk prediction. CNN shows great
accuracy, which indicates that its real-life clinical application in predicting highrisk pregnancies would result in a considerable improvement in maternal care.
Adding AI-driven models to existing healthcare settings could assist in the faster
and more accurate evaluation of pregnancy risk, particularly in low-resource
settings, boosting focused preventative therapy and evidence-based clinical
decision-making. The expanding presence of AI has the potential to revolutionize
healthcare, taking us closer to scalable automated solutions for maternal health
that correspond with global healthcare development goals, with implications
from this study

                    wide, emphasizing the need for accurate and early diagnosis. This research
                    explores the potential of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
                    techniques for breast cancer prediction, leveraging their ability to process
                    and analyze complex medical data. A comprehensive dataset was used to
                    evaluate and compare multiple models, including traditional ML algorithms
                    such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, alongside advanced
                    DL architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The study
                    focuses on feature selection, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter opti-
                    mization to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that the DL
                    models outperform traditional ML approaches in accuracy, sensitivity, and
                    specificity. This paper provides insights into the capabilities and limitations
                    of these methods, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence in improving
                    clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

                    Suicide is an undeniable threat to our society nowadays. 
                    People of all ages are committing suicide. Most of them remain in depression before committing suicide.

                    Suicide is an undeniable threat to our society nowadays. 
                    People of all ages are committing suicide. Most of them remain in depression before committing suicide. 
                    They often share their posts and thoughts on social networks to express the suffering they are going through. Suicide prevention has become a critical concern in the digital age, with social media platforms providing valuable information on people's mental health. This study will classify suicide-related posts using machine learning and with the help of different deep neural network models, for example, BERT, CNN, ANN, LSTM, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach. We used Twitter and Reddit datasets, which have two columns: tweet and the target column (potential suicide or non-suicide), applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for preprocessing and feature extraction. Our research systematically evaluates multiple models to determine their effectiveness in predicting the ideation of suicide. This research comes up with the idea that deep learning-based models, especially BERT, CNN, and CNN-LSTM, outperform traditional ML classifiers for predicting the presence of tendencies with suicide, with 98.12\% accuracy in BERT rather than 94\% in SVM and Random Forest. This study shows that AI-powered methods can be used to rapidly assess the odds of suicide risk in early stages. It contributes to the ever-growing scope of AI in mental state by showing the application of NLP methodologies to the monitoring and intervention of suicide risk in real time.
